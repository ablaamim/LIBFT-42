## :information_source: What is LIBFT :

Summary: This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll
be allowed to use in all your other projects

---

## :wrench: Mandatory part :

In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.
Some of the functions’ prototypes you have to re-code use the
"restrict" qualifier. This keyword is part of the c99 standard.
It is therefore forbidden to include it in your prototypes and to
compile it with the flag -std=c99.
You must re-code the following functions. These function do not need any external
functions:

• isalpha

• isdigit

• isalnum

• isascii

• isprint

• strlen

• memset

• bzero

• memcpy

• memmove

• strlcpy

• strlcat

• toupper

• tolower

• strchr

• strrchr

• strncmp

• memchr

• memcmp

• strnstr

• atoi

You must also re-code the following functions, using the function “malloc”:

• calloc

• strdup
